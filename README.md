KTAP: An open-source flexible system for sensorimotor synchronization tapping experiments using Arduino

Abstract
Synchronizing finger tapping to a sequence of tones (sensorimotor synchronization or SMS) is a simple and undemanding task. This task is useful not only in research on basic rhythm and timing but also in research on clinical disorders that affect the basal ganglia and cerebellum. An SMS research apparatus requires a combination of high accuracy and precision to guarantee that the tones are presented both accurately and precisely. The tapping response input must be reliably registered without delays or missing/surplus responses. Although a percussion pad and a MIDI-based system using cross-platform MAX software has predominantly been used, we developed KTAP, an open-source flexible hardware and software system for SMS experiments with ultra-high accuracy and precision. The SMS parameters can be edited to conduct various paradigms involving synchronization-continuation, phase/period shifts, and background white noise in both auditory and visual SMS experiments. For auditory SMS, the tone pitch can be manipulated for music experiments. Latency measurements of our system revealed accuracy and precision at the sub-millisecond level. KTAP is an open-source system freely available from https://github.com/ChanghyeonKim93/K-Tap.
